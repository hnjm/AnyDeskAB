AnyDesk AddressBook

This is in a very early stage of development.
Eventually, it should provide a fully featured AddressBook system for [AnyDesk](https://anydesk.com):
* Create groups to organize all connection items
* Easily drag & drop items groups
* Support custom descriptions for each connection item
